## Resources Used
Laravel


# Database and Environment variables

In Laravel, environment variables are usually stored in a file called .env, located in the root of the project. To access these variables within the Laravel application, you can use the env() function.

## Connection to Database in Laravel

Database configuration is done in the config/database.php file. This file uses environment variables to define connection details.

## Accessing the Database
Laravel uses Eloquent ORM and Query Builder to interact with the database.

## Migrations

Migrations allow you to define the structure of the database through migration files.


### Creating a migration:

```
php artisan make:migration create_users_table
```

### Running migrations:

```
php artisan migrate
```

## Seeds
Seeders allow you to populate the database with initial data.

### Creating a seeder:

```
php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder
```

### Running seeders:

```
php artisan db:seed --class=UsersTableSeeder
```
